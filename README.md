# Party Game

This is a card based party game where one player gets a question and everyone else gets to pick the best answer.
The player with the question can then pick which one is their favorite and that player gets a point.

I made this game to implement react hooks and firebase firestore/realtime database.

Note: This was designed and styled with mobile in mind. Cards data taken from cards against humanity.
